# Contribution guidelines

We want this guide to be a great starting point for new comers to CISCO APIs.
As such, we want it to be quick and easy to go through, pick a technology and go through.

# API entries

For each technology, we'll propose :
- an introduction with a maximum of 2 or 3 generic lines
- the pointer to the API documentation
- links to other resources relevant to development : labs, tutorials
- active Cisco technology community members   
  
# Grouping 

We'll try to group technologies in domains,
Let's make this grouping evolve as new technologies get added.
Several grouping may be introduced over time...

# Resources selection

We encourage resources which do not require authentication.
Let's say Cisco Devnet will be the exception ;-)

# Granularity

We'll try to make a technology no more than 20 lines, to keep this guide viewable in a single page.
We'll may introduce a second level of page if a section gets growing over acceptable limits.

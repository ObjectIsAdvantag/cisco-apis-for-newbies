# Contribution guidelines

We want this guide to be a great starting point for new comers to CISCO APIs.
As such, we want it to be quick and easy : browse the page, pick a technology, select resources, done.

# API entries

For each technology, we'll propose :
- a maximum of 2 or 3 introduction text
- pointer to the API documentation
- links to other resources relevant to development : labs, tutorials, sandboxes, articles
- active Cisco technology community members 
  
# Grouping 

We'll try to group technologies by general concern domains : Cloud, Dev tools, Collaboration, Networking, Web frameworks...

Let's make this grouping evolve as new technologies get added.

Several grouping may appear to be relevant over time.
We'll see how to handle this aspects : tagging, query API ...

# Resources selection

We encourage resources which do not require authentication.
Let's say Cisco Devnet will be the exception here ;-)

# Granularity

We'll try to make a technology no more than 20 lines, to keep this guide viewable in a single page.

We'll may introduce a second level of page if a section gets growing over acceptable limits.

TO integrate

Tropo PHP resources you may go through to get a quick view of the possibilities of the platform.
As I am pretty well versed on the Tropo technical and presentation aspects, I think it can very pretty quick for us to sync up and make it a great talk and learning sessions for PHP devs.
All PHP script samples can be run in a click on the Tropo platform.

# About

This guide is a tentative to synthesize Cisco APIs for developers & ITPros with no to little knowledge of Cisco lines of hardware and software products.
 
Started as a tribute to my "First Days Party" @Cisco Live Berlin Feb15-19 2016.

## Cisco Spark APIs

Since March 2015, [Cisco Spark](https://www.ciscospark.com/) is the all-in-one collaboration platform for the extended entreprise. 
In short, Cisco Spark is a multi-client platform (Phone, Mac, Windows apps), backed by Cloud Collaboration Services (persistent chat rooms, WebRTC video conferencing), enabling 1-1, 1-few, 1-many communication. 
Cisco Spark can be used for short-live meeting rooms, but also long-live collaborative workspaces, opened to internal co-workers, but also partners and external communities.

The overall Cisco Spark platform can be managed via [REST APIs](https://developer.ciscospark.com/getting-started.html) : easily bring messaging capabilities into your apps, automatically send messages to Spark rooms based on real-world/business events.

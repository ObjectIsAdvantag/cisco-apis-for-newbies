# About

This guide is a tentative to synthesize Cisco APIs for developers & ITPros with no to little knowledge of Cisco lines of hardware and software products.
 
Started this guide as a tribute to my "First Days Party @Cisco" Live Berlin Feb15-19 2016"


# First steps

You definitely need to check the [DevNet portal](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp), the one-stop for all development related activites with/to/from/above CISCO technologies.

Take a few minutes to create your accout, it's really worth it :
- [DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp): umbrella to technical resources about IoT, Cloud, Networking, Data Center, Collaboration, Analytics & Automation, Security, Services, DevOps, Microservices
- [Learning labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/springboards) : step by step walkthrough on live environments to interact with CISCO APIs
- [Programming foundation](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/programming-found) : learn REST principles and how to call them via a User Interface, from the command line, or from code
- [Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/): provision various CISCO hardware and network topologies and experiment Live APIs. Envs are provisionned for your own use from 3 hours to 7 days. APIC-EM , Cisco Open SDN Controller , Jabber , Webex , Intercloud Fabric... 
- [DevNet Labs](- Technical articles) : Showcase of software projects built out from CISCO APIs and/or open technologies

## CiscoSpark APIs

CiscoSpark is the all-in-one collaboration platform for the extended entreprise. 
To make it quick, Spark is a multi-platform client backed by Cloud Collaobration Services (tchat, voice, video), enabling 1-1 and 1 to many communication. 
Spark can be used for short-live  meeting rooms, but also long term collaborative workspaces, opened to internal co-workers, but also partners and external communities.
The overall CiscoSpark platform can be managed via REST APIs : 

- [Spark for developers](https://developer.cisco.com/site/spark/): the DevNet umbrella for all Spark related contents for developers

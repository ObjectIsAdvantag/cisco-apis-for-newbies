Starting this guide as a tribute to my "First Days Party @Cisco", ie "Cisco Live Berlin Feb15-19 2016"


# First steps

You definitely need to check the [DevNet portal](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp), the one-stop for all development related activites with/to/from/above CISCO technologies.

Take a few minutes to create your accout, it's really worth it :
- [DevNet portal](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp): umbrella to technical resources about IoT, Cloud, Networking, Data Center, Collaboration, Analytics & Automation, Security, Services, DevOps, Microservices
- [Learning labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/springboards) : ramp up on interacting with CISCO APIs
- [Programming foundation](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/programming-found) : learn REST principles and how to call them via a User Interface, from the command line, or from code (Python effectively)
- [Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/): provision various CISCO hardware and network topologies and experiment Live APIs. Envs are provisionned for your own use from 3 hours to 7 days. APIC-EM , Cisco Open SDN Controller , Jabber , Webex , Intercloud Fabric... 
- [DevNet Labs](- Technical articles) : Showcase of Software projects built out of CISCO open technologies
